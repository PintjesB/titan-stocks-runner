# GitHub Actions runner pre-job hook for Titan Stocks.
#
# The hook runs in the runner user's context immediately before a
# workflow job starts. It enforces the documented host-boundary
# contract so a missing capability is caught before the job wastes
# cycles:
#
#   * Docker daemon is reachable through the bind-mounted socket.
#     The daemon's reported architecture MUST match the native
#     runner architecture (``amd64`` or ``arm64``); an emulated or
#     mismatched daemon is rejected so a degraded host cannot pass
#     the host-boundary contract.
#   * The ``host.docker.internal`` alias resolves. Workflow service
#     containers and Compose-published HTTP services are reached
#     through this alias.
#   * The Docker CLI, Compose v2 plugin, and Buildx plugin resolve.
#   * Node 24 and Python 3.12 are available on ``PATH``.
#   * The Playwright Chromium cache contains at least one Chromium
#     binary directory.
#
# The native runner architecture is read from the
# ``RUNNER_ARCH`` env var (``X64`` or ``ARM64``) supplied by the
# GitHub Actions runner based on the listener's actual
# architecture; the host-architecture mapping is documented in
# ``deploy.sh``. Any other value (or an unset value) aborts the
# hook before the rest of the contract runs so a misconfigured
# deployment cannot dispatch a job.
#
# The hook never modifies host state and never reaches out to the
# network. A failure exits non-zero so the runner reports the job
# as failed rather than letting it run on a host that cannot
# satisfy the workflow's preconditions.
