# GitHub Actions runner post-job hook for Titan Stocks.
#
# The hook runs in the runner user's context immediately after a
# workflow job finishes. It enforces a bounded hygiene contract
# anchored on the documented ``titan-stocks-playwright-`` project
# label:
#
#   * Only Compose projects whose name matches the documented
#     Titan CI prefix ``titan-stocks-playwright-`` are torn down.
#     The runner's own ``titan-runner`` container is left alone.
#   * The shared Playwright browser volume and the persistent
#     ``titan-runner-state``, ``titan-runner-work``,
#     ``titan-runner-browser``, and ``titan-runner-codex`` volumes
#     are NEVER touched. ``docker compose down -v`` removes only
#     volumes owned by the matching child project; the external
#     runner volumes are excluded by construction.
#   * The shared Playwright ``.cache/ms-playwright`` and any
#     Docker build cache are NEVER pruned.
#   * No ``docker system prune``, ``docker volume prune``, ``docker
#     image prune``, ``docker builder prune``, or ``docker network
#     prune`` is invoked.
#   * The runner ``_work`` directory is NEVER recursed into. The
#     bounded cleanup only targets the matching Compose projects;
#     any non-Titan checkout, any application development volume,
#     and any unrelated workspace is left alone. The runner-owned
#     named volumes titan-runner-state, titan-runner-work,
#     titan-runner-browser, and titan-runner-codex are protected
#     storage and are never removed by this hook.
#
# The hook is intentionally permissive on failure: a cleanup error
# must not fail the workflow job that just succeeded. Errors are
# logged so operators can investigate, but the exit code is always
# zero unless something fundamentally unsafe happens.

# container (``titan-runner``) and any future ``titan-`` workload
