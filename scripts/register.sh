# Register the persistent Titan Stocks runner against GitHub.
#
# Architecture
# ============
#
# Registration is the one phase that requires a fresh registration
# token. It runs from the one-shot ``register`` Compose service
# declared in ``docker-compose.yml`` (or directly via
# ``deploy.sh register``, which invokes that service with ``--rm``).
# The service:
#
#   1. Serializes concurrent registrations through an exclusive flock
#      inside the persistent state volume so two ``up`` invocations
#      cannot race the registration against an in-flight credential
#      replacement.
#   2. Inspects the existing state volume and the
#      ``diagnostics.txt`` summary to detect whether the persisted
#      identity (repository URL, runner name, label list) already
#      matches the requested identity. A complete match exits
#      successfully without contacting GitHub and without requiring a
#      token.
#   3. With a non-empty ``RUNNER_TOKEN``, registers the runner
#      against GitHub and replaces any persisted credentials with
#      the fresh ones. The previous credentials are backed up first
#      and restored on *ordinary* commit errors (the script
#      ``config.sh --replace`` exit code is documented as the only
#      commit-error surface we can roll back locally). A
#      transaction failure on the GitHub side that follows a
#      successful local commit is the documented ``--replace``
#      limitation: the remote runner record is gone and the new
#      credentials may not yet be valid; the operator must inspect
#      the failed commit manually.
#   4. Without ``RUNNER_TOKEN`` and with a missing or drifted
#      identity, fails with actionable guidance. The script does NOT
#      mutate the persistent state in this case: no backup is
#      written and the previous credentials remain untouched.
#   5. Reads ``RUNNER_TOKEN`` from the in-container environment
#      (forwarded by Compose from ``TITAN_RUNNER_TOKEN`` in ``.env``)
#      and unsets it immediately after ``config.sh`` returns so it
#      never reaches the persistent state, the diagnostics file, or
#      any later ``start-runner`` invocation.
#
# Rollback scope
# ==============
#
# The local rollback is best-effort. ``config.sh --replace`` is the
# documented one-shot registration primitive; the script does not
# claim that a GitHub-side rollback can be performed transactionally
# once the local ``config.sh --replace`` commit has succeeded. An
# ordinary commit error (a non-zero ``config.sh`` exit) restores the
# previous local credentials; the operator still has to clean up
# the GitHub-side runner record manually if the local commit
# succeeded but the GitHub handshake failed afterwards. The script
# exits non-zero on both paths so the Compose listener stays down.
#
# Environment variables
# =====================
#
#   RUNNER_TOKEN         Short-lived registration token. Optional on
#                        the steady-state path: an empty token is
#                        accepted when the persisted identity is
#                        already complete. Required when the persisted
#                        identity is missing or has drifted.
#                        Provided through the in-container environment
#                        by the Compose registration service.
#   REPO_URL             Repository clone URL the runner targets
#                        (e.g. ``https://github.com/owner/repo``).
#   RUNNER_NAME          Display name. Defaults to
#                        ``titan-ci-<hostname>``.
#   RUNNER_LABELS        Comma-separated custom capability labels.
#                        Defaults to ``titan-ci``. GitHub
#                        automatically attaches ``self-hosted``,
#                        ``linux``, and the architecture label
#                        (``X64`` or ``ARM64``) based on the
#                        listener's actual platform; the
#                        custom-label list intentionally omits them
#                        so a future architecture migration is a
#                        GitHub-side change rather than a
#                        ``TITAN_RUNNER_LABELS`` rotation.
#   RUNNER_STATE_DIR     Persistent state directory. Defaults to
#                        ``/var/lib/titan-runner/state``.
#   RUNNER_RUNTIME_DIR   Disposable runtime tree used during
#                        registration. Defaults to
#                        ``/var/lib/titan-runner/runtime``.
#   RUNNER_WORK_DIR      GitHub ``_work`` directory. Defaults to
#                        ``/var/lib/titan-runner/work``.
#   RUNNER_BROWSER_DIR   Playwright cache directory. Defaults to
#                        ``/var/lib/titan-runner/browser``.
#   RUNNER_ROOT          Image-owned runner tree. Defaults to
#                        ``/opt/actions-runner``.
#
# Exit codes
# ==========
#
#   0  Registration complete (or already complete).
#   1  Required configuration missing or invalid.
#   2  Registration token missing or identity drift detected.
#   3  Runner configuration failed.
#   4  Registration lock could not be acquired.
#   5  Local credential publication failed; the EXIT handler restores
#      the previous local state or clears a fresh partial state.
