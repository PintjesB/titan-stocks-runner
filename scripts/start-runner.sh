# Start the persistent Titan Stocks GitHub Actions listener.
#
# Architecture
# ============
#
# The image-owned tree, persistent state, and disposable runtime
# cooperate at startup. Registration and listening share this one
# container, while persisted identity means ordinary restarts do not
# need a new registration token.
#
#   /opt/actions-runner         Image-owned immutable binary tree
#                              (e.g. ``run.sh``, ``config.sh``,
#                              ``runsvc.sh``).
#
#   /var/lib/titan-runner/state    Persistent named volume. Holds
#                              the Actions runner ``.runner`` and
#                              ``.credentials*`` files.
#
#   /var/lib/titan-runner/runtime  Materialised tree built fresh on
#                              every container start by copying the
#                              immutable image tree and overlaying
#                              the persistent state. The listener
#                              reads its configuration from here and
#                              writes its logs here. A container
#                              recreation can discard the runtime
#                              completely without losing the GitHub
#                              identity.
#
#   /var/lib/titan-runner/work     Persistent ``titan-runner-work``
#                              named volume used as GitHub's ``_work``
#                              directory. Child job containers mount the
#                              same external volume at this fixed path.
#
#   /var/lib/titan-runner/browser  Persistent named volume. Holds
#                              the Playwright Chromium browser cache.
#                              Seeded from the baked image cache
#                              ``/home/runner/.cache/ms-playwright``
#                              on the first start; subsequent starts
#                              reuse whatever the volume already
#                              contains.
#
#   /home/runner/.codex        Persistent ``titan-runner-codex``
#                              named volume. Holds replaceable Codex
#                              authentication state. Losing this volume
#                              only requires another device login.
#
#   /opt/titan-probe/node_modules  Image-owned ``playwright-core``
#                              dependency tree. The capability probe
#                              resolves ``NODE_PATH`` onto this
#                              directory instead of running
#                              ``npx playwright-core`` at probe time.
#
# On every start the script:
#
#   1. Runs the idempotent ``register`` phase in this same container.
#      A matching persisted identity exits immediately; a fresh or
#      changed identity requires ``RUNNER_TOKEN``. The token is unset
#      before the listener is launched.
#   2. Refuses to run if registration did not leave a non-empty
#      ``state/.runner`` and ``state/.credentials``.
#   3. Grants the host Docker socket's GID to the runner user as a
#      *supplemental* group; the primary ``runner`` group is
#      preserved.
#   4. Ensures all persistent directories, including ``CODEX_HOME``,
#      are owned by the non-root ``runner`` user.
#   5. Rebuilds the runtime tree from ``/opt/actions-runner`` and
#      overlays the persisted registration files onto it.
#   6. Seeds the persistent browser volume from the baked image
#      cache only on the first start; subsequent starts use the
#      existing contents.
#   7. Launches ``run.sh`` directly via ``gosu`` with no runtime
#      flags. ``--disableupdate`` is set at registration and
#      persists in the ``.runner`` manifest.
#
# Environment variables
# =====================
#
#   RUNNER_STATE_DIR    Persistent state volume. Default
#                       ``/var/lib/titan-runner/state``.
#   RUNNER_RUNTIME_DIR  Disposable runtime tree. Default
#                       ``/var/lib/titan-runner/runtime``.
#   RUNNER_WORK_DIR     Fixed ``_work`` path in the persistent
#                       ``titan-runner-work`` volume. Default
#                       ``/var/lib/titan-runner/work``.
#   RUNNER_BROWSER_DIR  Persistent Playwright cache. Default
#                       ``/var/lib/titan-runner/browser``.
#   RUNNER_BROWSER_SEED Baked image cache the persistent volume is
#                       seeded from on first start. Default
#                       ``/home/runner/.cache/ms-playwright``.
#   RUNNER_ROOT         Image-owned source tree. Default
#                       ``/opt/actions-runner``.
#   CODEX_HOME          Persistent Codex configuration/auth path.
#                       Default ``/home/runner/.codex``.
#   RUNNER_TOKEN        Short-lived GitHub registration token. It is
#                       consumed by ``register`` and unset before the
#                       listener process starts.
#
# Exit codes
# ==========
#
#   0  Listener exited cleanly.
#   1  Required configuration missing or invalid.
#   2  Registration token missing for a new or changed identity.
#   3  GitHub runner configuration failed.
#   4  Listener exited non-zero.
