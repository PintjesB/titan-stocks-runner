# Compose migration after the runner repository split

The repository move to `runners/titan/` and `runners/oportunist/` does not by itself stop already-running containers. The deployment files on a runner VM are local files, and the existing Titan GHCR image name remains `ghcr.io/pintjesb/titan-stocks-runner`.

## Titan

An existing Titan Compose deployment can keep running while you schedule the migration. Update it before using Codex or before the next normal image refresh.

Use the current files from `runners/titan/` as the source of truth. In particular, the current Compose model adds:

```yaml
environment:
  CODEX_HOME: /home/runner/.codex

volumes:
  - titan-runner-codex:/home/runner/.codex

volumes:
  titan-runner-codex:
    name: titan-runner-codex
```

The existing `titan-runner-state`, `titan-runner-work`, and `titan-runner-browser` volume names are unchanged, so adopting the current Compose file reuses the existing GitHub registration, workspace, and browser cache.

Runner releases now publish independent SemVer tags in addition to `latest`. Prefer an explicit version in `.env`, for example:

```text
TITAN_RUNNER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/pintjesb/titan-stocks-runner:1.0.0
```

This keeps deployments predictable while allowing Renovate to propose image upgrades automatically. If the deployment uses `:latest`, run `docker compose pull` before recreating the runner; `latest` moving in GHCR does not restart a running container by itself.

After deployment, authenticate Codex once:

```bash
cd runners/titan
docker compose exec --user runner runner codex login --device-auth
docker compose exec --user runner runner codex login status
```

Deleting `titan-runner-codex` only removes Codex authentication. Recreate the runner and repeat the device login.

## Oportunist

Use `runners/oportunist/docker-compose.yml` rather than adapting the Titan Compose file. Its persistent state is intentionally separate:

- `oportunist-runner-state`
- `oportunist-runner-work`
- `oportunist-runner-codex`

Use the profile's explicit SemVer image tag so Renovate can track upgrades:

```text
OPORTUNIST_RUNNER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/pintjesb/oportunist-runner:1.0.0
```

After first registration, clear `OPORTUNIST_RUNNER_TOKEN` from `.env` and recreate the container so the short-lived token is no longer present in Docker's stored container environment metadata.

Authenticate Codex once with:

```bash
cd runners/oportunist
docker compose exec --user runner runner codex login --device-auth
docker compose exec --user runner runner codex login status
```

## Versioning

Titan and Oportunist version independently. Each profile's `VERSION` file defines the minimum SemVer on its current major/minor line. Successful publishes inspect the existing GHCR tags and add the next patch release, while re-running an already-published digest reuses its existing SemVer tag.

To deliberately start a new release line, update only that profile's `VERSION` file, for example `1.0.0` to `1.1.0` or `2.0.0`.

## Repository rename

The GitHub repository is now `PintjesB/github-runners`. Existing Git remotes pointing at the former repository name are redirected by GitHub, but update local remotes when convenient:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:PintjesB/github-runners.git
```

The GHCR package names intentionally remain independent of the source repository name.
