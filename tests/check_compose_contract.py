# Validate the documented Compose startup contract using the
# resolved Compose model rather than the raw YAML surface.
#
# The contract requires:
#
#   * Exactly one service: ``runner`` (the long-running listener).
#   * Registration runs inside the runner's startup entrypoint; there
#     is no disposable Compose service or ``depends_on`` gate.
#   * The workspace is the explicit ``titan-runner-work`` named volume
#     mounted at the fixed internal path; the Docker socket is the only
#     host bind mount.
#   * Persistent ``titan-runner-state``, ``titan-runner-work``, and
#     ``titan-runner-browser`` named volumes are declared explicitly.
#
# A regression that drops any of these surfaces blocks the
# ``publish.yml`` workflow contract job and prevents publication.
#
# The validation prefers ``docker compose config`` because it
# resolves variable interpolation, the bind-mount source and
# target, and the volume declarations exactly the way Compose
# itself would. When the docker CLI is unavailable the script
# falls back to parsing the YAML surface; an available Compose CLI
# must always parse the real file successfully.
