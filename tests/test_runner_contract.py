"""Contract tests for the Titan Stocks self-hosted runner.

The tests pin the image, the Compose runtime contract, the
operator-facing configuration knobs, and the lifecycle script
behaviour. They run from CI on a hosted runner without Docker
so they only validate the project files; the behavioural
assertions (Docker daemon reachability, Chromium launch, native-
architecture enforcement) live in ``deploy.sh probe`` and the
published image.

Lifecycle invariants covered here:

* Image builds target the multi-platform ``linux/amd64`` and
  ``linux/arm64`` manifest with the documented capabilities and
  a pinned Actions runner; the architecture-specific digest is
  selected from ``RUNNER_SHA256_X64`` / ``RUNNER_SHA256_ARM64``
  based on BuildKit's automatic ``TARGETARCH`` build argument.
* ``fetch-runner.sh`` maps ``TARGETARCH`` to the upstream archive
  naming (amd64 -> x64, arm64 -> arm64), selects the matching
  pinned digest, and refuses every other architecture before any
  download attempt.
* The persistent state layout is named volume + host bind mount,
  not a single container filesystem.
* ``deploy.sh probe`` and ``deploy.sh register`` use
  ``--entrypoint`` to override the image's default listener
  entrypoint.
* ``deploy.sh up`` does not mount the registration token file and
  does not propagate ``RUNNER_TOKEN`` into the listener
  environment.
* The listener runs only ``run.sh`` with no runtime
  ``--start``/``--disableupdate`` flags.
* The Compose contract mounts the host work directory at the same
  absolute path inside the container.
* Persistent volumes declare an explicit ``name:`` so
  ``docker run`` and ``docker compose`` references resolve to the
  same Docker volume.
* The container HEALTHCHECK verifies only the listener process
  and Docker daemon reachability.
* The Playwright probe consumes the deterministic
  ``/opt/titan-probe`` install instead of ``npx``.
* The listener runs on an ordinary Compose bridge network with
  the Docker host-gateway alias wired through ``extra_hosts``.
* ``ipc: host`` is forbidden; an isolated ``shm_size`` is wired
  instead.
* Registration reads the short-lived token through an allowlisted
  ``RUNNER_TOKEN`` env var; no token-file mount reaches the
  listener or the persistent state.
* Pre-job and post-job hooks validate host capabilities (and the
  Docker daemon's native architecture) and clean up only Titan-
  prefixed resources.
