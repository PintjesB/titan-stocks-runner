#
# Titan Stocks self-hosted GitHub Actions runner image.
#
# This image powers the persistent self-hosted runner that executes
# every job from the private Titan Stocks repository. The image is
# published as a multi-platform manifest supporting both
# ``linux/amd64`` and ``linux/arm64``; an application job runs once
# on whichever compatible ``titan-ci`` runner is available. The
# dedicated VM remains the security boundary: the runner mounts the
# VM's Docker socket directly and reaches the daemon as a
# supplemental group on the runner user.
#
# Registration consumes a single short-lived registration token
# through an allowlisted ``RUNNER_TOKEN`` env var; the long-running
# listener authenticates with the GitHub-issued secret persisted in
# a dedicated state volume, attaches to a normal Compose bridge
# network, and listens for jobs until it is redeployed.
#
# Build:
#
#   docker buildx build \
#     --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
#     --tag ghcr.io/pintjesb/titan-stocks-runner:dev --load .
#
# BuildKit supplies an automatic ``TARGETARCH`` build argument.
# ``fetch-runner.sh`` maps it to the upstream archive naming
# (amd64 -> x64, arm64 -> arm64) and verifies the architecture-
# specific pinned digest before any download attempt. Every other
# architecture is refused up front so a wrong platform never reaches
# the network.
#
# Update procedure:
#
#   1. ``RUNNER_VERSION`` below must track the current GitHub-
#      supported ``v2.x`` line. GitHub ends runner support 30 days
#      after a new release; this image MUST be rebuilt before the
#      cutoff.
#   2. ``RUNNER_SHA256_ARM64`` is the SHA-256 of the upstream
#      tarball ``actions-runner-linux-arm64-${RUNNER_VERSION}.tar.gz``
#      and ``RUNNER_SHA256_X64`` is the SHA-256 of the upstream
#      tarball ``actions-runner-linux-x64-${RUNNER_VERSION}.tar.gz``;
#      both digests are published by ``actions/runner``. Refresh
#      all three values together; the lifecycle scripts verify the
#      architecture-specific digest before any job is allowed to
#      register against GitHub.
#   3. ``PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION`` is consumed by the image's capability
#      probe only. Containerized Playwright application installs do
#      not need to match.
#
# The image runs as a non-root ``runner`` user. The Docker socket
# is bind-mounted read/write by the persistent Compose configuration
# and the host socket's group ID is mapped onto the runner user at
# start time so the docker CLI can reach the daemon without sudo.
